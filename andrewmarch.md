##Professional Experience

###Entrust Datacard - Principal Consultant Developer
*January 2012 to present*

Working within the Field Services group to provide development consultancy across the Entrust range of authentication and public key infrastructure products.

As principal consultant my role includes providing direction to the development team, guiding team practices and co-ordinating resourcing with other groups within the organisation. In this capacity I have pushed for the introduction of standardised issue tracking, managed the migration of source control from ClearCase to Git and built out continuous integration to support continuous deployment. 

I was recognised with others for a "customer excellence award" in 2015 for my work on the performance optimisation of a national ID PKI deployment. This project required the rapid development a number of load test utilities to apply calculated load to a system to guide the tuning of the products.

###Systematic Software Engineering - Systems Engineer
*July 2009 to December 2011*

While with Systematic my primary role was as a Systems Engineer within the UK Defence Integration Group. This team utilised agile development practices to deliver C4I interoperability solutions and technical proof of concepts to meet immediate operational requirements. This gave me the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects alongside domain experts and operational users to gain the required knowledge to successfully deliver solutions which met the demands of military deployment. My work often involved the extension of the company’s off the shelf products to integrate more tightly to the customer’s specific environment and requirements.

One of the main themes of my work was the development of a technologies to improve the operator experience of the company's products; this include a streamline deployment tool, a real time log analysis framework and a state restoration tool. As a result of this work I was asked to contribute to the development of the dismounted soldier application to develop an interface for use while wearing protective equipment. 

In addition to my development role I was asked to take over responsibility for UK support desk. This position allows me frequent contact with our customers while coordinating with the globally dispersed support team. As part of this role I was involved in documenting our processes to meet our audit requirements to retain our ISO 9001:2000 certification.

###Morgan Stanley - Associate Developer
*June 2007 to June 2008*

For the industrial placement year of my degree course I interned with Morgan Stanley attached to the Enterprise Data Group. Whilst there I worked on two large development projects, the first a secure notification system the second was a desktop application to assist the allocation the department’s staff and resources. These projects gave me experience Linux, Sybase Adaptive-SQL, Java, C# and IBM MQ.
Throughout my internship I was able to attend a wide variety of training courses, these covered both technical skills including Windows development and scripting languages, as well as softer skills such as working in dispersed teams and test driven development practices. In addition to these formal courses I took part in organising departmental presentations on various technical topics, this involved arranging speakers, securing conference facilities and promoting the events. 
While with Morgan Stanley I participated in the company's volunteering scheme within the local community.
