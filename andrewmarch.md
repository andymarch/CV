## Professional Experience

### Entrust Datacard - Senior Software Developer
*September 2016 to present*

I transferred internally within Entrust Datacard to join the newly formed PKI Solution, Maintenance and Escalation group.

I am the principal developer for the Roaming Server product delivering major releases as well as patches for supported versions. I planned and delivered a schedule of work to migrate this solution from C++ to our Java toolkit using Spring Boot. This migration improved the supportability of the product and allowed the implementation of a number of customer requested features. A critical feature I worked on was the server implementation of the password authenticated key exchange, while cryptographically complex this also had to ensure compatibility with multiple differing client implementations.

I was promoted to lead for Solution Delivery within the group. This role has responsibility for the co-ordination of PKI product enhancements with partners, key customers and our field services teams. As part of this role I led a program for performance testing new releases in the Authority product suite. This involved working with stakeholders both from the development and managed services teams to determine what data would be most beneficial, selecting suitable test techniques and designing appropriate test plans. To meet these requirements I developed automation to deploy and execute tests in AWS EC2 with JMeter. During this testing I was able to identify and resolve a performance restriction allowing for a threefold increase in SCEP request processing. The culmination of this project involved a presentation to the engineering management group and the processes used have formed part of a new internal performance testing framework.

As part of my escalation responsibility I work closely with a wide variety of our customers to address issues and queries with a number of our PKI products with a specific focus on our administrative and security toolkits.

I was presented an "excellence award" in 2018 for my work during the platform migration of a key customer. 


### Entrust Datacard - Principal Consultant Developer
*January 2012 to September 2016*

As a professional services consultant I worked with customers and partners across the EMEA region, both pre and post sale, to deliver projects based around the Entrust range of MFA (multi-factor authentication), IdAM (Identity and access management) and PKI (public key infrastructure) products. As a member of the development consultancy I implemented customisations and bespoke solutions in Java, C++ and C# as well as on Android. These projects ranged in complexity from one-off utilities to full web and desktop applications with ongoing support agreements. 

I was the regional subject matter expert for the IdentityGuard multi-factor authentication solution. In this capacity I delivered partner, customer and developer training courses as well as providing feedback to product management on roadmap based on regional requirements.

Following my promotion to principal consultant I mentored junior developers, guided development team practices and co-ordinated resourcing with other groups in the organisation. I introduced issue tracking and agile planning practices for custom developments, managed the migration of source control from ClearCase to Git and built out a continuous integration environment with Jenkins. These processes dramatically improved the level of success the team had delivering projects on-time, on-specification and to a high standard.

I was recognised in 2015 for a "customer excellence award" for my work on the performance optimisation of a national ID PKI deployment.

### Systematic Software Engineering - Systems Engineer
*July 2009 to December 2011*

Working within the UK Defence Integration Group I contributed to a variety of projects dealing with the conversion between national and NATO message text formats and the processing of signal data (GPS, radar and AIS). The majority of this work was C# .NET interacting with the underlying Microsoft SQL databases and secure message queues.

One of my key projects was developing an extension for IRIS Forms to customise the display of messages with HTML and Javascript in response to an immediate operational requirement. The adoption of this technique by a number of customers required me to design and deliver training courses to military personnel. 


### Morgan Stanley - Associate Developer
*June 2007 to June 2008*

For the placement year of my degree I interned with Morgan Stanley in the Enterprise Data Group. I worked on two large development projects, these gave me exposure to Sybase, C# .NET and IBM MQ. Throughout my internship I took part in organising departmental technical presentations.
