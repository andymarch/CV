## Professional Experience

### Entrust Datacard - Software Developer
*September 2016 to present*

Transferred internally to the newly formed PKI Escalation team this team handles support escalations cases requiring code inspection and patches to the Authority PKI product suite. I was assigned responsibility for the Roaming Server product which is a large C++ solution with nearly two decades of development. Having completed a code review I prepared a number of recommendations and combined with existing customer feature requests outlined a roadmap for the next version release.

I have lead an internal program for performance testing. This has involved working with stakeholders both from the development and managed services teams to determine what data would be most beneficial, selecting suitable test techniques and designing and executing the appropriate test plans. As part of this work I have developed a number of scripts to automate the testing in AWS EC2 allowing us to scale testing efficiently. This has formed part of a new framework for applying performance testing across the Authority product suite. This testing has been effective in highlighting a number of potential areas for improvement as well as items which must be managed as the application is scaled.


### Entrust Datacard - Principal Consultant Developer
*January 2012 to September 2016*

Working with customers and partners across the EMEA region to scope and deliver development consultancy based around the Entrust range of authentication and public key infrastructure products. This required involvement in the full project life cycle from initial contact, through design, development and deployment to maintenance. As a member of the development consultancy I delivered customisations and bespoke solutions in Java, C++ and C# as well on Android, these ranged in complexity from custom branding skins and one off utilities through full web and desktop applications with ongoing support agreements.   

As principal consultant my role included mentoring junior developers, guiding development team practices and co-ordinating resourcing with other groups within the organisation. I introduced issue tracking and agile planning practices for custom developments, managed the migration of source control from ClearCase to Git and built out a continuous integration environment. These processes dramatically improved the level of success the team had delivering projects on-time, on-specification and to a high standard.

In a presales capacity I advised on RFI and RFP responses specifically focusing on capabilities to extend the products with custom components to meet requirements. I regularly represented the company at trade events and delivered partner, customer and developer training courses for the IdentityGuard multi-factor authentication solution. I was nominated as the regional subject matter expert for this product, providing feedback to product management on roadmap goals based on regional requirements.

I was recognised with others for a "customer excellence award" in 2015 for my work on the performance optimisation of a national ID PKI deployment. This project required the rapid development a number of load test utilities to apply calculated load to a system to guide the tuning of the products to attain the throughput requested by the customer.

### Systematic Software Engineering - Systems Engineer
*July 2009 to December 2011*

The UK Defence Integration Group utilised agile development practices to deliver C4I interoperability solutions and technical proof of concepts to meet immediate operational requirements. This gave me the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects alongside domain experts and operational users to gain the required knowledge to successfully deliver solutions which met the demands of military deployment. This involved working in a CMMI level 5 environment to ensure a high standard of quality in any of our deployed product. My work often involved the extension of the company’s off the shelf products to integrate more tightly to the customer’s specific environment and requirements. One of the main themes of my work was the development of a technologies to improve the operator experience of the company's products; this include a streamline deployment tool, a real time log analysis framework and a state restoration tool. The most successful was based on operational user feedback I developed an extension for IRIS Forms which customised the display of medevac messages to more closely mirror the radio message dramatically reducing the time required to transcribe the message. As a result of this work I also provided training courses to customer staff to allow them to built additional views from a toolkit of components I had developed.

In addition to my development role I was asked to take responsibility for UK support desk. This position allowed me frequent contact with our customers while coordinating with the globally dispersed support team to identify and troubleshoot issues. As part of this role I was involved in documenting our processes to meet our audit requirements to retain our ISO 9001:2000 certification.

### Morgan Stanley - Associate Developer
*June 2007 to June 2008*

For the industrial placement year of my degree course I interned with Morgan Stanley attached to the Enterprise Data Group. Whilst there I worked on two large development projects, the first a secure notification system the second was a desktop application to assist the allocation the department’s resources. These projects gave me experience Linux, Sybase Adaptive-SQL, Java, C# and IBM MQ.
Throughout my internship I took part in organising departmental presentations on various technical topics, this involved arranging speakers, securing conference facilities and promoting the events.
