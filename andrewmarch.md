## Professional Experience

### Entrust Datacard - Senior Software Developer
*September 2016 to present*

I transferred internally within Entrust Datacard to join the newly formed PKI Escalation team where I was assigned responsibility for Roaming Server. I prepared the project plan for the next major release to migrate the functionality to Java and led the development effort basing the implementation on Spring. This project uses the Kanban methodology drawing in additional resources from the security assurance and QA groups. A critical feature I worked on was the implementation of the password authenticated key exchange, the complexity of multiple client implementations leant itself to a test driven development approach to ensure that each was correctly supported. During development a number of unscheduled patches have been required for existing versions of Roaming Server. These included investigating an issue where high load on a hardware security module resulted in decryption errors failing client authentication requests.

I led a program for performance testing a new release in the Authority product suite. This involved working with stakeholders both from the development and managed services teams to determine what data would be most beneficial, selecting suitable test techniques and designing appropriate test plans. As part of this work I developed automation to deploy and execute the tests in AWS EC2. During this testing I was able to identify and resolve a performance restriction allowing for a threefold increase in SCEP request processing. The culmination of this project involved a presentation to the engineering management group and the processes used have formed part of a new internal performance testing framework.


### Entrust Datacard - Principal Consultant Developer
*January 2012 to September 2016*

As a professional services consultant I worked with customers and partners across the EMEA region, both pre and post sale, to deliver projects based around the Entrust range of authentication, access management and public key infrastructure products. As a member of the development consultancy I implemented customisations and bespoke solutions in Java, C++ and C# as well as on Android. These projects ranged in complexity from one-off utilities to full web and desktop applications with ongoing support agreements. 

I was the regional subject matter expert for the IdentityGuard multi-factor authentication solution. In this capacity I provided feedback to product management on roadmap based on regional requirements. I also delivered partner, customer and developer training courses for this product suite.

Following my promotion to principal consultant I mentored junior developers, guided development team practices and co-ordinated resourcing with other groups in the organisation. I introduced issue tracking and agile planning practices for custom developments, managed the migration of source control from ClearCase to Git and built out a continuous integration environment. These processes dramatically improved the level of success the team had delivering projects on-time, on-specification and to a high standard.

I was recognised in 2015 for a "customer excellence award" for my work on the performance optimisation of a national ID PKI deployment.

### Systematic Software Engineering - Systems Engineer
*July 2009 to December 2011*

Working within the UK Defence Integration Group I contributed to a variety of projects dealing with the conversion between national and NATO message text formats and the processing of signal data (GPS, radar and AIS). The majority of this work was C# .NET interacting with the underlying Microsoft SQL databases and secure message queues.

One of my key projects was developing an extension for IRIS Forms to customise the display of messages with HTML and Javascript in response to an immediate operational requirement. The adoption of this technique by a number of customers required me to design and deliver training courses to their staff. 


### Morgan Stanley - Associate Developer
*June 2007 to June 2008*

For the placement year of my degree I interned with Morgan Stanley in the Enterprise Data Group. I worked on two large development projects, these gave me exposure to Sybase, C# and IBM MQ. Throughout my internship I took part in organising departmental technical presentations, this involved arranging speakers, securing conference facilities and promoting the events.
